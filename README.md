# Instructions for downloading Readers Hub

## Step 0: Install Git
Download git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the walkthrough, all default options should be good. Don't touch them unless you know what you're doing.
## Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Valerie2807/library_managment.git
```
We already have code up on GitHub so the first step is to "clone" a copy of what we have on your local machine. To begin, open up a terminal (on windows use Git Bash or WSL to follow the commands used in this tutorial) and navigate to where you'd like your project to be located. If you have a "projects" folder, this would be the place. This command will navigate you to your home directory
##  File system:
Verify that you are in the directory that contains the file `main.py` in Readers Hub(`library_managment`) directory.
